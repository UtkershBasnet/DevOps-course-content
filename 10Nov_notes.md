# Introduction to Docker

## 1. What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, deploy, run, 
update, and manage containers. Containers are standardized, executable 
packages that include everything needed to run an application—code, runtime, 
system tools, libraries, and settings.

## 2. Why Use Docker?
- **Consistency:** If it works on your machine, it will work in production.
- **Isolation:** Each container has its own resources and dependencies, 
  preventing conflicts with other containers or the host system.
- **Portability:** Docker containers can run on any machine that has Docker 
  installed (Linux, Windows, Mac, Cloud).
- **Efficiency:** Containers share the host OS kernel, making them much lighter 
  and faster than traditional Virtual Machines (VMs).

## 3. Docker Architecture
- **Docker Daemon (dockerd):** The background service that manages Docker 
  objects like images, containers, networks, and volumes.
- **Docker Client:** The primary way many users interact with Docker. When you 
  use commands like `docker run`, the client sends these commands to the daemon.
- **Docker Registry:** A stateless, highly scalable server-side application 
  that stores and lets you distribute Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub).
- **Docker Objects:**
    - **Images:** Read-only templates with instructions for creating a Docker 
      container.
    - **Containers:** Runnable instances of images.
    - **Networks:** Allow containers to communicate with each other.
    - **Volumes:** Preferred way to persist data generated by and used by 
      Docker containers.

## 4. Basic Docker Commands
- `docker --version`: Check Docker version.
- `docker run <image>`: Pull an image (if not local), create a container, and 
  start it.
- `docker ps`: List running containers.
- `docker ps -a`: List all containers (including stopped ones).
- `docker images`: List all locally available images.
- `docker stop <container_id>`: Stop a running container.
- `docker rm <container_id>`: Remove a stopped container.
- `docker rmi <image_id>`: Remove a local image.

## 5. Docker vs. Virtual Machines (VMs)
- **VMs:** Have their own guest operating system, which requires more 
  resources (RAM, CPU, Storage) and takes longer to boot.
- **Containers:** Share the host's OS kernel, are lightweight, start in 
  seconds, and use significantly fewer resources.

## 6. Main Benefits of Containerization
- **Agility:** Faster development and deployment cycles.
- **Scalability:** Easily spin up or down instances based on demand.
- **Maintainability:** Easier to update and roll back versions.

## 7. Conclusion
Docker has revolutionized the way software is developed and deployed. By 
providing a consistent and lightweight environment, it has bridged the gap 
between development and operations, making the DevOps philosophy a practical 
reality.
